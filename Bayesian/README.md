# Bayesian Statistics
Bayesian statistics is a statistical framework that involves using probability to represent uncertain knowledge about an uncertain event. In Bayesian statistics, a probability is considered to be a measure of the degree of belief that an event will occur. This belief is updated as new evidence becomes available.

The main idea behind Bayesian statistics is that we can use probability to represent our uncertainty about the world, and that we can update our probabilities as new evidence becomes available. For example, if we are trying to estimate the probability that it will rain tomorrow, we might start with a prior probability based on past weather patterns. If we then observe that the sky is cloudy and the forecast calls for rain, we can update our probability to be higher. This process of updating probabilities based on new evidence is known as Bayesian updating.

One of the key features of Bayesian statistics is that it allows us to incorporate prior knowledge and subjective judgment into our statistical analysis. This can be especially useful when dealing with complex or poorly understood phenomena.

There are many different techniques and approaches that fall under the umbrella of Bayesian statistics, including Bayesian inference, Bayesian modeling, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. These techniques are used in a wide variety of fields, including machine learning, data analysis, and finance.
